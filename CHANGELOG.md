 - Added function this bindings to behave more lexically (use of `.bind(service)`)
 - Optional `model` argument for `current` and `get`, allowing user to control application of model function

# 1.0.9

 - Added `force` parameter to `publish` so users can react to events rather than just changes

# 1.0.8

 - Simplified `subscribe` (no longer a Promise)
 - Added `defer` parameter to `using` and `refreshing` to help avoid reacting to initial empty data"
